This is the MasterLink Intelligent Work Management (IWM) system, licensed under GPL V3.0 (see included LICENSE file).

IWM is a work management / asset management system, which makes best use of a workforce by optimally assigning work to workers. IWM was developed for facilities maintenance and manufacturing applications in mind, but can be applied to a wide variety of problems. 

This repository represents a reimplementation of IWM using a new approach to scheduling. It is not a completed product, but does have a scheduler core and screens to perform demonstrations and testing. The previous version of IWM is a complete, field-able product, and can be found on github at masterlink-iwm.

This application deploys on tomcat and embedded JBoss and uses a standard SQL database backend.
